            <h1>How to create a Dropshipping Business in 2025</h1>

            <h2>What is dropshipping?</h2>
            <p>Before considering dropshipping as a business idea you may use, you must first understand what it is. Dropshipping is an <strong><em>online business method</em></strong> where you sell products to customers without ever making and holding the items yourself. You act as a middleman to re-sell products originally produced by another company, and make profit off of the margin between what you bought it for and what you re sold it for. It can be a great first business, as there is no real cost of entry before you start selling items.<br><br></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Decide whether you want to make a convincing product or not</li>
                <li>Find items to dropship-- this can be done by searching websites such as AliBaba for cheap items (example on left)</li>
                <li>If you want to make a more convincing product, order the items to your property.</li>
                <li>Repackage-- this can use a full new box, or can be a design over the original </li>
                <li>If you want to cut corners, you can always keep the same packaging and send the product directly to buyers.</li>
                <li>Make an account for a tiktok shop page or Facebook Marketplace</li>
                <li>Create a page for the item-- It can be a good idea to use AI to make videos or images, or simply copy the page you bought it from</li>
                <li>Choose pricing for the item. You <em>CAN</em> mark it up multiple times its value, but it is a good idea to use intuition as higher prices will drive away customers</li>
                <li>You can advertise the product, or just wait to get purchases.</li>
                <li>Ship the item to any buyers, either directly from the business or from where you packaged them.</li>
            </ol>
