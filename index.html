            <h1>How to create a Dropshipping Business in 2025</h1>
            
            <h2>What is dropshipping?</h2>
            <p>Dropshipping is where you become a middle man, reselling cheap items for a higher price.</p>
            <h2>How YOU can dropship</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Decide whether you want to make a convincing product or not</li>
                <li>Find items to dropship-- this can be done by searching websites such as AliBaba for cheap bargain</li>
                <li>Order items to your property</li>
                <li>Repackage-- this can use a full new box, or can be a design over the original </li>
                <li>If you want to cut corners, you can always keep the same packaging.</li>
                <li>Make an account for a tiktok shop page or Facebook Marketplace</li>
                <li>Create a page for the item-- It can be a good idea to use AI to make videos or images</li>
                <li>You can make fake comments and reviews on account-- can be a difficult process but will bring more consumers or cover up for a poor product</li>
                <li>Ship the item to any buyers, either directly from the business or from where you packaged them.</li>
            </ol>
